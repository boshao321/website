My name is Bo Shao, but most people just call me Bo. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Logistics Engineering from Fuzhou University and am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

I love outdoor hiking because being close to nature brings me a sense of inner peace. I also enjoy cooking, and there’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of tasting my own culinary creations. One of my favorite quotes is: “*Put your head down and fight, fight, fight. Never, ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine.*”
